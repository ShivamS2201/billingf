--------- Things to keep attention on -------------<br>
1. In user registeration take an important look on hirarachy of the values and api calls being made to look out for wrong happening as user gets deleted if billing info is not configured properly so use it wisely.&#x2713;
2. To gte the count of sales, hoffice and beamnch for a particular use make either a single api with params and carefully pass the parameters to function to see sepecfifc user changes.&#x2713;&#x2713;
3. Simply utlise the made components to do things for levels of Sales, Hoffice and branch. &#x2713;

----------------------------------------to be done--------------------------<br>
- Need to add a api call to check for Username (Either call for all usernames in the db or take value to db and check across and send a message accordingly)
 or I can use handle chnge like function from - login.js

 - Use handle change fucntion to compare system credit and pass on value in user registeration form.    &#x2713;
 - Make a choice from states coming through api and mapped in the opion field.
 - If error returns in register this saves from User prevent default from hatao all content and we use the useeffect to see any changes at all which make validated false at time when changes happen after a registerion request all though we will add a link to naviogate ot to sales page. &#x2713;
