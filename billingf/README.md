1. I need to generalize the table for all the components, Thus data prep and cfunctionality has to be separated.
2. Need to configure Active and inactive on click in tables. requests are made only need to work on the UI and CTA button.
3. Make Users and send the build to render and configure the application on server. Need to build CI/CD pipelines to normalize my work and be able to keep functionaiong as I send feature updates.

As of Now:
Backend and database are hosted on render. Tables were giving error which has been dealt with. try building this.

Need to handle, Twilio Exceptions in the backend If number is invalid or exception occurs.
